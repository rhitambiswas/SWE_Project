------------
Thin wrapper around an Ultralytics YOLO model for road-damage detection.

MODEL
-----
Ships with models/road_damage_yolov8s.pt — a YOLOv8-small checkpoint from
the open-source project https://github.com/oracl4/RoadDamageDetection,
trained on the Japan + India subsets of the CRDDC2022 / RDD2022 dataset.
It detects four classes: Longitudinal Crack, Transverse Crack,
Alligator Crack, Potholes.

DECISION LAYER (three tiers, not two)
--------------------------------------
Per the project's Track B design, the ML model detects and a separate
layer decides how much to trust it. There are three outcomes now:

  1. "damaged"              - a specific class cleared ACCEPT_THRESHOLD.
                              Reliable enough to name a damage type.
  2. "uncertain"             - a specific class cleared CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD
                              but not ACCEPT_THRESHOLD. Named, but shaky.
  3. "damaged_unclassified"  - NEW. No single class cleared even
                              CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD, but several different
                              classes each fired weakly in the same image
                              (see FALLBACK below). The model can tell
                              something is off, just not what.
  4. "normal"                - none of the above.

FALLBACK FOR UNCLASSIFIABLE DAMAGE
------------------------------------
This exists because of a real failure case: a photo of severe
earthquake-caused pavement rupture was reported as "no damage detected."
Investigating showed the model's own raw output (before thresholding) had
picked up on the crack — Alligator Crack 0.26, Longitudinal Crack 0.16,
Transverse Crack 0.11, several overlapping boxes — but no single class
alone reached the 0.35 confidence floor, because the damage didn't
cleanly match any one of the four trained categories.

Rather than bolt on a second model from another repo, this combines the
SAME model's own sub-threshold signals: if multiple different damage
classes are each weakly firing in the same photo, that pattern itself is
evidence something abnormal is on the road, even without a clean
class win. We combine all raw per-box confidences with a noisy-OR:

    P(something is wrong) = 1 - product(1 - confidence_i)

Tested against the earthquake photo (0.67) vs. ~30 sampled frames of
ordinary dashcam driving footage (0.00-0.29, mostly 0.00) — a threshold
around 0.45 cleanly separates the two in this small sample. This is a
starting point, not a final answer: validate it against a real batch of
your own road photos before trusting it, the same as the other threshold.

WHY NOT JUST ADD A SECOND MODEL FROM ANOTHER REPO?
-----------------------------------------------------
It was considered and is still an option later, but it has a real
limitation worth knowing before reaching for it: almost every
open-source road-damage repo (including this one) is trained on the same
handful of public datasets (RDD2022/CRDDC2022 and close relatives). A
second closed-set damage classifier sourced from that same ecosystem
would very likely share this exact blind spot, since none of those
datasets contain earthquake-style rupture examples either — so it might
add maintenance cost (a second framework/dependency, another model to
version and re-verify, real thought needed on how to merge two models'
verdicts) without reliably catching the case that prompted this. A model
trained on a genuinely different task framing (e.g. subjective road
*quality* rating, or one-class anomaly detection trained only on normal
roads) would be more likely to add real independent signal — that's the
option worth pursuing if this in-model fallback proves insufficient.
